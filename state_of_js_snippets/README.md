# State of JS 2023 snippet(s)
## filter changes over time by category

This graph seemed informative but busy to me, so I tried to filter it by category. The interesting stuff is done on the canvas, so I might try to dig in some day, but for now you can at least toggle labels by going to State of JS's [changes over time graph](https://2023.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/#tools_arrows) copying the code in [filter_time_graph.js]() into the dev console and invoking any of the commented function calls.
