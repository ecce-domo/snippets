# Github
## contributions.js
Look at stats about a Github user's contribution graph. Navigate to a Github [user profile](https://github.com/ecce-domo/) and paste the code in [contributions.js](https://github.com/ecce-domo/snippets/tree/main/github/contributions.js) into the dev console.

### histogram
Creates a historgram to show how frequent days with *n* contributions are. e.g. if the result is `{0: 300, 1: 60, 2: 5, 3: 1}`, there are 300 days with 0 contributions, 60 days with 1 contribution, and so on.

### highest contributions
Shows highest number of contributions in a single day and the dates with that many contributions.

## paint_it_green.js
Use the contribution graph as a canvas. Hover over a square in the legend (Less ‚¨úÔ∏è üü© üü© More) to select a color; hover over a day in the contribution graph to paint it that color.
