# Snippets!
Just playing around with snippets :)

- [github](https://github.com/ecce-domo/snippets/tree/main/github)
    - [show](https://github.com/ecce-domo/snippets/tree/main/github/contributions.js) stats about a github user's contribution graph
    - [turn](https://github.com/ecce-domo/snippets/tree/main/github/paint_it_green.js) the contribution graph into a green canvas
- [state_of_js_snippets](https://github.com/ecce-domo/snippets/tree/main/state_of_js_snippets)
    - I wanted to make that one graph a little more legible
