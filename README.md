# Snippets!
Just playing around with snippets :)

- [state_of_js_snippets](https://github.com/ecce-domo/snippets/tree/main/state_of_js_snippets) - I wanted to make that one graph a little more legible
- [github](https://github.com/ecce-domo/snippets/tree/main/github) - show stats about a github user's contribution graph
